# Chat Application

**A cross-platform chat application built for mobile**

---

### Stack: React Native, jQuery, GraphQL and Java

**Concepts Explored:** 
- Java Websockets
- React Native
- GraphQL
- jQuery

---

### Overview
During my job search process, I noticed a pattern in the skills that a lot of companies were asking for. One company in particular mentioned Java, React Native, GraphQL and jQuery in their desired/required skills, so I thought that I should try and develop my skills in these areas to help increase my value as a candidate and step outside my comfort zone which for a long time has been solely C#/.NET and React focused.

**Future Plans:**
- User authentication with OAuth2.0
- Proper mobile app that allows chatting between two different clients
- Connect/Disconnect and other server messages appear in the chat
- Unit & Integration tests (React Native + Java)
